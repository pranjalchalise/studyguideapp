Our project aims to develop a study aide that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to help students study and engage more effectively with academic materials. Some of our initial concepts include allowing users to upload class content—such as lecture slides and PDF readings—and automatically generate helpful study resources, including summaries, structured notes, and quizlets.
Upon upload, the app will extract and analyze the text from the provided documents, identify key concepts, and generate outputs tailored to the class. The interface will allow students to view and interact with their generated study materials directly within the app. Depending on time constraints, we may create subsections for individual classes where students can upload material from one class and update it throughout a semester. The minimum viable product will support uploading PDF files and generating summaries, notes, and quizzes for a typical college-level subject.
